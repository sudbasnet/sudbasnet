# Thanks for checking-out my github profile.

💻 Most of my repos are me ExperimentingWith || Building various Software Development && Data Science projects

🎓 I graduated with a Master of Science degree in Computer Science on Aug-2019, I am currently working as a Technical Consultant with a focus on Software Development and Data Engineering in the retail & supply chain area

🤖 I am more of a GENERALIST, I have various interest areas but all of them fall under "Software Development" or "Data Science" umbrellas

🖥️ I'm currently focusing on Fullstack Software Development, using Node (with TypeScript), Express, MongoDb and, Vue/React (or sometimes Angular). I feel like I have gotten pretty good with the MEVN and MERN stack 😊
