💻 Most of my repos are me Learning || Building some Software && Data Science projects

🎓 I graduated with a MS degree in Computer Science on Aug-2019. Professionally, I am a Software Engineer, it is a fullstack role but I do focus more on the Frontend.

🤖 I am more of a GENERALIST, I have various interest areas but all of them fall under "Software Engineering" or "Data Science" umbrellas
