💻 Most of my repos are me Practicing || Experimenting || Building various Data Science && Web Development projects

🏫 Some of my repos are projects I did during my time as a graduate research and teaching assistant at the [University of Nebraska - Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/)

🎓 I graduated with a Master of Science degree in Computer Science on Aug-2019, I am currently working as a Technical Consultant in the retail & supply chain area

🤖 I am more of a GENERALIST, I have various interest areas but all of them fall under "Software Development" or "Data Science" umbrellas

🖥️ I'm currently focusing on learning Fullstack Web Development using NodeJS (learning to use TypeScript), Express, MongoDb and VueJS (or sometimes Angular)
