# Thanks for checking-out my github profile.

💻 Most of my repos are me Practicing || Experimenting || Building various Web Development && Data Science projects

🏫 Some of my repos are projects I did during my time as a graduate research and teaching assistant at the [University of Nebraska - Lincoln](https://www.unl.edu/)

🎓 I graduated with a Master of Science degree in Computer Science on Aug-2019, I am currently working as a Technical Consultant in the retail & supply chain area

🤖 I am more of a GENERALIST, I have various interest areas but all of them fall under "Software Development" or "Data Science" umbrellas

🖥️ I'm currently focusing on Fullstack Web Development, using Node (with TypeScript), Express, MongoDb and, Vue/React (or sometimes Angular). I feel like I have gotten pretty good with the MEVN and MERN stack 😊
